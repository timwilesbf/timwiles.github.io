Dear supporters,

It's been a fantastic 2 months for the Peta project. Together with the international development charity
Knofacic (based in Bristol, UK), and working closely with David (our contact in Peta) we are now nearing
construction of a new house for a 56-year-old AIDS patient called John (not his real name). 

John was previously
living in a mud hut with no income. He is skilled in tailoring but did not have the funds to purchase a 
sewing machine to start his business.

[More information on the "House for John" sub-project](house-for-john/index.md).

We hope to continue this work as and when more funds are collected, to give a helping hand to a second family in the
area.

There were provisional plans to run a medical outreach in Peta, but these plans have been put on hold until the 
lockdown restrictions in Uganda have been lifted to allow medical professionals to travel.

## What happened to the original project?

You may recall that the project was initially titled "A house for Arthur before the rains come". The 
beneficiary of this project was an elderly diabetes patient living in Peta. Following Arthur's 
death in mid-2020 (whilst funds were still being collected) the decision was made to repurpose the
project to care for others in the community of Peta who were victims of poverty and disease.

This aid and development work could not come at a better time for this community - The strict coronavirus
lockdown in Uganda has led to many losing their jobs. In addition, the travel restrictions have
caused equally many to be without access to medical care.

## How to donate
